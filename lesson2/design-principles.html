            This design demonstrates the use of visual hierarchy by calling
            attention to the most important elements. The image of the chocolate
            product is the largest and most important element, and is the main
            focus of the page. The Shop button is very bold with its contrasting
            color and size, and signifies its importance in the hierarchy,
            falling just below the product image. The paragraph heading is next
            in the hierarchy, followed by the paragraph itself. This hierarchy
            guides the user through the page and highlights the components in a
            way that will get a quick reaction from the user.

            The use of white space and clean design in this page allows the
            images of the food to be the main focus, as well as the Order
            buttons. The size of the images and the contrast in color with the
            white space also boost the productâ€™s presence on the page. The
            background is uncluttered with unnecessary text and descriptions,
            because the product speaks for itself. This simple design approach
            is effective in providing a spotlight for the product that will be
            visually appealing to the user.

            Repetition through the use of the color orange on this page unifies
            the page elements. Buttons, icons and horizontal rules are
            consistently orange and contrast with the text and background. There
            are many elements on this page, and utilizing a consistent color
            creates harmony by making the page not appear so busy and cluttered.
            It allows the information to be given, but in a balanced way that
            does not distract from the products.
