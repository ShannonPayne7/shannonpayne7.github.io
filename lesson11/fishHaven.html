            <h3>The Legend of the Bear Lake Monster</h3>
            <p>By Linda Weaver Clarke</p>
            <p>
              The mystery of the Bear Lake Monster has been an exciting part of
              Idaho history ever since the early pioneers arrived in 1863.
              Prominent leaders of the area encouraged the Indian legend because
              no one had a desire to move to the cold Bear Lake country. The
              valley was located at the tops of the Rocky Mountains in southern
              Idaho and the winters were harsh.
            </p>
            <p>
              The legend of the Bear Lake Monster made life a little more
              exciting for the pioneers. Som people claimed to have seen it and
              gave descriptions of it. Throughout the years, no one has ever
              disproved the Bear Lake Monster. A bunch of scientists tried to
              discredit the monster and said it was a huge codfish that was
              shipped in from the East. Does the Bear Lake Monster exist? Is it
              fact or fiction, legend or myth?
            </p>
            <p>
              The legend of the Bear Lake Monster began with the Natives who
              inhabited this valley. When the settlers arrived in 1863, the
              Indians told them all about the Great Bear Lake Monster. It had
              captured and carried off two of their braves while swimming. The
              legend came alive when people began reporting its existence.
            </p>
            <p>
              The interesting thing is that all the reports have pretty much the
              same description. The monster's eyes were flaming red and its ears
              stuck out from the sides of its skinny head. Its body was long,
              resembling a gigantic alligator, and it could swim faster than a
              galloping horse. It had small legs and a huge mouth, big enough to
              eat a man.
            </p>
            <p>
              Is the Bear Lake Monster fact or fiction, legend or myth? Whatever
              conclusion is drawn, the legend still lives on and brings a great
              deal of mystery and excitement to the community. Remember, when
              visiting Idaho, never doubt the Bear Lake Monster or you'll be
              frowned upon. No one makes fun of the great legend of Bear Lake
              Valley!
