          <h2>City of Mesa History and Demographics</h2>
          <article class="history">
            <p>
              The city of Mesa and the surrounding region, have been home to
              varied peoples who have both contributed and left their mark for
              the residents today. The Hohokam Indians were the first
              established peoples in the area, and spent at least 1500 years
              farming and developing the land, using a sophisticated canal
              system, which they designed and built. These hundreds of miles of
              canals allowed them to thrive in the desert and were the
              foundation for the canals which future settlers would use. The
              Hohokam Indians mysteriously disappeared from the land around 1450
              A.D., and the region has no known history until the mid-19th
              century when the United States Army relocated Apache Indians to
              the area, and opened the way for settlement.

              In 1877 Mormon Pioneers arrived in Mesa, and built several small
              communities in the Mesa area, one of them being on a mesa
              overlooking their original fort. The city was incorporated and
              given its name on July 17, 1878, and by 1883 had 300 residents.
              The city has gone through many changes, from being primarily an
              agricultural community to a thriving suburb of Phoenix, with
              amenities that can make anyone feel right at home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today Mesa has a population of over half a million residents, and
              is the third largest city in Arizona. Mesa prides itself on
              retaining its small-town feel despite its size, and the downtown
              area is full of small shops and businesses. From antique stores to
              clothing shops, to bakeries and cafes, the people and business
              owners of Mesa will welcome you in. Mesa is home to many museums
              and archaeological sites, making learning easy and fun. The Cactus
              League for Major League Spring Training resides in Mesa, and
              offers an exciting springtime of baseball. The downtown area is
              home to the Mesa Arts Center, where culture and inclusion combine
              to offer great performances and learning opportunities. The light
              rail connects Mesa to Phoenix and offers access to even more
              sporting and performance events. Mesa has it all, a small-town
              atmosphere with big city events and attractions. We welcome you!
